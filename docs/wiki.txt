# Entities
    - program as a whole consisted of commands
    - program is executed on cores
    - every core reads whole program
    - 1 dst px per 1 core
    - what is our caching strategy?

# Algorithm
    1. slice & cache
    1. every core needs:
        1. neihbour src pixels, dx, dy
        1. whole prog
        1. write access to dst ROI
        1. info about dst & src pos

# Commands
    1. blit - algoritam
    1. stretch-blit - algoritam
    1. src - rule
    1. src-over - rule


# Functional tests
    - surface to image
    - dummy blit
    - dummy dummy stretch blit
    - dummy command reader
    - parallel command reader
    - parallel command executor
    - porter duff
    - gravity
    - finished float point
    - move to fixed point
